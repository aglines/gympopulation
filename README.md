# gympopulation
When is the gym I go to most / least crowded?  The gym site shows the current number of people there.  I can scrape this data and construct a model of the population flow over time.

Components:
- Selenium to scrape the data
- Windows VM running on AWS to have code running constantly over a few weeks' period
- Graphical rendering of the data

Tech I hope to learn:
- AWS
- VM
- Graphical rendering of data
