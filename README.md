# gympopulation
When is the gym I go to most / least crowded?  The gym site shows the current number of people there.  I can scrape this data and construct a model of the population flow over time.

DONE:
X Set up AWS
X got a VM running (Windows not Ubuntu)
X installed python/Se/webdriver
X code runs successfully on VM

TODO:
- set up db (sqlite) to store
- grab numerical part of returned string, store that
- run code as scheduled task




Components:
- Selenium to scrape the data
- Windows VM running on AWS to have code running constantly over a few weeks' period
- Graphical rendering of the data

Tech I hope to learn:
- AWS
- VM
(not doing) Ubuntu (could use Windows, might revert to that just to get the app done)
- Graphical rendering of data (d3? unknown)

Tech I already am familiar with:
- Selenium (headless? that'd be new)
- SQLite
